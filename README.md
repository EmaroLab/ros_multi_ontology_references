# A Ros Multi Ontology References (aRMOR)
The complete ARMOR service: its direct dependencies, and a python client example.
This repository contains four ROS packages:
 - [multi ontology reference](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference) (AMOR)
 - [armor](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor)
 - [armor_msgs](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_msgs) 
 - [armor_py_api](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_py_api)

**aRMOR** is a ROS service depending on *AMOR* (a OWLAPI-based library), and *armor_msgs*, which contains the ROSjava-based input and output interfaces of aRMOR.
The project contains also an example of a Python service's client that uses our *api* to perform some simple manipulations and queries to a [test](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_py_api/blob/master/test/test.owl) OWL ontology.

# Gettint Started
Each package is a Git sub-module (i.e., a repository, see [here](https://github.com/EmaroLab/docs/wiki/GitHub-Tutorial-to-Manage-Project-with-SubRepositories#clone-the-project) for a simple guide).
For installing the progect use:
 - `cd your_caktnig_ws/src`
 - `git clone git clone https://github.com/EmaroLab/ros_multi_ontology_references.git`
 - `cd ros_multi_ontology_references/`
 - `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`
 - `cd ..`
 - `catkin_make`

For runnig the project use in different terminals:
 - `rosrun armor execute it.emarolab.armor.ARMORMainService`
 - `rosrun armor_py_api client_test.py`

You can further test the server by using for instance
```
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
    client_name: ''
    reference_name: 'reference'
    command: 'QUERY'
    primary_command_spec: 'CLASS'
    secondary_command_spec: 'RESTRICTIONS'
    args: ['Class_4']" 
```
Check here the complete list of requests thet the service can digest.

# Known issues

aRMOR gives an elementary interface to SPARQL ([issue](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor/issues/5#issuecomment-479956294)).
We made aMOR in order to accommodate a better support for SPARQL, but we are not planning to support them soon.
If you want to contribute and share your idea or findings, we are happy to help.

Also, it is recommended to use ontology with entities having a common IRI root.
For importing entities with different IRIs and convert them to a common root we use the ontology editor [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/).

We use such an editor also for designing ontological structures that do not change at run-time.
Indeed aMOR does not support the whole OWL operators, but it focus only on the once that most often are needed in robotic applications.
Therefore, it is common to design complex but static semantic off-line, and load them through file at run-time with manipulation and querying purposes.
