# A ROS Multi Ontology References (aRMOR)
### The complete ARMOR service: its direct dependencies, and a python client example.

This repository contains four ROS packages:
 - [multi ontology reference](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference) (aMOR)
 - [armor](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor)
 - [armor_msgs](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_msgs) 
 - [armor_py_api](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_py_api)

**aRMOR** is a ROS service depending on *AMOR* (a OWLAPI-based library), and *armor_msgs*, which contains the ROSjava-based input and output interfaces of aRMOR.
The project contains also an example of a Python service's client that uses our *api* to perform some simple manipulations and queries to a [test](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_py_api/blob/master/test/test.owl) OWL ontology.

# Getting Started
Each package is a Git sub-module (i.e., a repository, see [here](https://github.com/EmaroLab/docs/wiki/GitHub-Tutorial-to-Manage-Project-with-SubRepositories#clone-the-project) for a simple guide).
For installing the progect make sure to have a working installation of **ROS** and **ROSJava** before to run
 - `cd your_catkin_ws/src`
 - `git clone git clone https://github.com/EmaroLab/ros_multi_ontology_references.git`
 - `cd ros_multi_ontology_references/`
 - `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`
 - `cd ../..`
 - `catkin__make`

For runnig an *hello-world* example, run in different terminals:
 - `rosrun armor execute it.emarolab.armor.ARMORMainService`
 - `rosrun armor_py_api client_test.py`

You can further test the server by sending requests manually, for instance:
```
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
    client_name: ''
    reference_name: 'reference'
    command: 'QUERY'
    primary_command_spec: 'CLASS'
    secondary_command_spec: 'RESTRICTIONS'
    args: ['Class_4']" 
```
Check [here](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor/blob/master/README.MD) all the aMOR features, and [here](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor/blob/master/commands.md) the complete list of requests thet the service can digest.

# Known Issues

aRMOR gives an [elementary](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor/issues/5#issuecomment-479956294) interface to SPARQL.
We made aMOR in order to accommodate a better support for SPARQL, but we are not planning to support them soon.
You are welcome if you want to contribute and share your idea and, if your findings are based on OWL-API, we are happy to integrate them in aRMOR.

Also, it is recommended to do not use ontology with entities having IRI with different roots.
For importing entities with different IRIs and convert them to a common root we use the ontology editor [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/).

With such an editor, we also implement ontological structures that do not change at run-time.
Indeed aMOR does not support the whole OWL operators, but it focus only on the once that most often are needed in robotic applications.
Therefore, it is common to design complex -but static- semantic off-line, and load them through file at run-time with manipulation and querying purposes.
